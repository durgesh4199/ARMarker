# ARMarker

Mobile-first WebAR app: the device camera detects printed image markers and
overlays 3D models, video, and DOM UI anchored to those markers. Built with
Vite + React + TypeScript, three.js, and MindAR's three.js image-tracking
integration (not the A-Frame one).

Status: **Milestone 0 — harness only.** No camera/AR code yet. See
`CLAUDE.md` (project brief) for the full build order.

## Stack and pinned versions

Every dependency is pinned to an exact version (no `^`/`~` ranges) in
`package.json`. Two are pinned for a specific reason, not just "latest at
scaffold time":

- **`three` is pinned to `0.161.0`, not latest.** `mind-ar@1.2.5`'s three.js
  bundle (`mind-ar/dist/mindar-image-three.prod.js`) imports `sRGBEncoding`
  from `three` and sets `renderer.outputEncoding`. Three.js removed that
  deprecated encoding API in `three@0.162.0` (Feb 2024) — one month after
  mind-ar 1.2.5 shipped. Any `three` version `>=0.162.0` throws an import
  error on load and mind-ar's three integration doesn't run at all. This was
  verified directly (installing successive `three` versions against
  `mind-ar@1.2.5` and checking for the export). `0.161.0` is the newest
  version where mind-ar's three.js path still works. Do not bump `three`
  without re-verifying against whatever `mind-ar` version is current at the
  time — mind-ar's peer range (`>=0.136.0`) does not reflect this ceiling.
- **`mind-ar` is pinned to `1.2.5`**, the latest published release (last
  updated Jan 2024). There is no newer version to track.

`mind-ar` also depends on `canvas` (`node-canvas`), which needs native
build tools at `npm install` time (Cairo/Pango headers) unless a prebuilt
binary matches your platform. On Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev pkg-config build-essential
```

`npm audit` will report vulnerabilities in `tar`/`@mapbox/node-pre-gyp`,
pulled in transitively through `canvas`'s native-build tooling. These are
build-time/install-time issues in `canvas`'s own toolchain, not in code that
ships to the browser bundle — `npm audit fix --force` would downgrade
`mind-ar` to `1.1.5` to "fix" this, which is a worse trade. Known accepted
risk until mind-ar publishes an update.

## Dev setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev -- --host
```

The dev server uses [`vite-plugin-mkcert`](https://github.com/liuweiGL/vite-plugin-mkcert)
for local HTTPS, which `getUserMedia` (camera access) requires on anything
other than `localhost`. On first run it downloads the `mkcert` binary — this
needs outbound internet access once; after that it's cached. Vite will print
a `https://<your-lan-ip>:5173` URL — use that on your phone.

### Testing on a physical phone

1. Make sure your phone and dev machine are on the same network, then open
   the printed `https://<lan-ip>:5173` URL on the phone. You'll need to
   accept the self-signed cert (mkcert's local CA isn't installed on the
   phone, only on the dev machine).
2. If the phone can't reach your machine directly (different networks,
   restrictive Wi-Fi, corporate VPN), tunnel instead:
   - `npx cloudflared tunnel --url https://localhost:5173`, or
   - `ngrok http https://localhost:5173`

   Either gives you a public HTTPS URL that proxies to your local dev
   server — open that on the phone instead.

### Remote debugging a device-only bug

Camera/AR bugs are frequently device-only (they won't repro in desktop
Chrome). To get a console on the device:

- **iOS**: Settings → Safari → Advanced → Web Inspector (on the phone), then
  Safari → Develop → `<your device>` (on a Mac) to get a full console
  attached to the mobile Safari tab.
- **Android**: enable USB debugging in Developer Options, plug in over USB,
  then open `chrome://inspect` on desktop Chrome and inspect the tab.

### Debug overlay

Append `?debug=1` to the URL to show a fixed-position overlay (top-left)
with live FPS, the currently detected target index/name, and asset load
state. It reads from a small Zustand store (`src/debug/debugStore.ts`) that
later AR milestones will feed; for now (M0) only FPS is live.

## Project structure

```
src/
  debug/            # ?debug=1 overlay + its store — built early per the brief
  App.tsx           # M0 placeholder shell; routing/bundle picker land in M5
```

Later milestones add `src/ar/ARStage.ts` (the imperative, non-React AR
runtime), `src/content/` (manifest types + Zod schema + the three content
renderers), and `src/routes/`.

## Build order

Each milestone is meant to run on a physical phone before the next starts —
see the project brief for the full list. Current: **M0 done** (this
harness). Next: **M1**, a tracking spike with one hardcoded marker and a
cube, to prove camera + detection + anchor pose on a real device.
